## Generated files

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `/data/go2rtc.yaml` | Listener configuration and generated Petlibro stream URL |
| `/data/appdaemon.yaml` | AppDaemon core, namespace, and MQTT plugin configuration |
| `/data/apps.yaml` | Discovery coordinator and one PLAF203 app per device |
| `/data/appdaemon-secrets.yaml` | MQTT credentials and feeder state-agent bearer token |
| `/data/devices.json` | Atomic mode-0600 device identity/address registry |
| `/data/appdaemon/` | AppDaemon app links and persistent namespace state |
| `/data/petlibro_camera_status_<stream>.json` | Per-stream atomic go2rtc camera runtime status; mode 0600 |
| `/data/petlibro_c2d_<stream>.dat` | Optional decrypted client-to-device dump |
| `/data/petlibro_d2c_<stream>.dat` | Optional decrypted device-to-client dump |

Generated YAML and secrets files are written with mode 0600. Do not copy them
into Git or attach them to public issues.

The generated AppDaemon configuration explicitly marks the `plaf203` namespace
as persistent with safe writeback. The manual-feed portion preference and a
diagnostic copy of the last verified feeder truth survive an add-on restart.
That copy is never used to generate a device write or feeding-plan response;
fresh feeder state from `/v1/core` is authoritative.

## Feeder state API and reconciliation

Persistent settings and feeding plans use the feeder-side read-only state API.
When `petlibro_state_agent_url` is empty, the renderer derives
`http://<discovered-feeder-ip>:8765` for each device. A custom URL may include
one `{ip}` placeholder. A fixed URL is suitable only when one feeder is
configured. The URL must use HTTP or HTTPS and cannot contain credentials,
query parameters, or a fragment.

Set `petlibro_state_agent_token` to the bearer token configured in the feeder
agent. The renderer places it in the mode-0600 AppDaemon secrets file and
references it with `!secret`; application logs never include it. The default
request timeout is two seconds.

The backend requires the tracked State Agent 0.2.0 schema. That agent rejects
any `state.bin` whose length is not exactly 236 bytes and labels decoded fields
as `persistent`, `effective_cached`, or `runtime`. Only persistent fields can
complete a setting verification; firmware-calculated cached enable flags and
runtime telemetry cannot.

On a feeder startup event or first heartbeat, the controller reads `/v1/core`
before accepting a persistent write. It then mirrors feeder settings and
semantic plan records into Home Assistant. Subsequent heartbeats use `/v1/rev`
and fetch the full state only when `core_rev` changes, during reconnect, or to
verify a pending write.

Persistent writes follow `READY -> PENDING_WRITE -> VERIFYING_WRITE`. An MQTT
acknowledgement only confirms protocol receipt. The controller reads
`/v1/core` after the acknowledgement and commits the result only when the
feeder-local value matches. A mismatch enters `DIVERGED`, republishes the
actual feeder value, and returns to `READY`. If the API is unavailable, the
controller remains outside `READY` and blocks persistent writes rather than
falling back to retained MQTT, Home Assistant, or AppDaemon storage.

### Feeding-plan edits

An edit is supported only for a plan ID already present in
`/v1/core.plans.semantic_records`; plan add/delete is not currently exposed.
Before every plan command the controller performs a fresh `/v1/core` preflight
and builds one full-collection MQTT payload from that response. It mutates only
the requested UTC hour, minute, weekday set, portions, derived one-shot flag,
and the target record's update timestamp. `enable_audio_raw` passes through as
the existing `enableAudio` field and must be 0 or 1; `audio_times` passes
through unchanged. The 64-bit `skip_end_time` is sent through the protocol. The
ten-byte opaque tail remains in the coordinator's cloned truth model and must
remain unchanged in the post-write readback; the current MQTT schema has no
field that exposes it. Runtime `execution_state` and regenerated `sync_time`
are excluded from semantic schedule equality.

After the acknowledgement, verification requires the same plan count and IDs,
the requested target change, unchanged target opaque fields, and byte-semantic
equivalence of every non-target record. `GET_FEEDING_PLAN_EVENT` also performs
a fresh core read. If it fails, the controller sends the protocol error form
with no plans instead of fabricating a schedule.

The state API exposes `audio_url`, but audio URL writes remain blocked because
tested firmware can restart when given an unreachable URL. The former
"automatic button lock" controls keep their MQTT entity IDs for compatibility,
but now mirror the binary-backed `auto_change_mode` and `auto_threshold`
configuration fields without claiming an unproven lock meaning. Manual feeding
is an action and continues to use its MQTT acknowledgement/event path instead
of expecting a persistent `/v1/core` change. Explicit feeder MQTT endpoint
persistence remains a separately gated recovery operation and is reported as
acknowledged-but-not-locally-verifiable because `/v1/core` does not expose
endpoint configuration.

## Device discovery and overrides

The coordinator builds `serial -> UID -> IP -> stream` from feeder MQTT traffic
and the LAN_SEARCH3/KNOCK2 probe. A valid device gets a direct-IP URL, so normal
playback does not repeat the slower subnet scan. It periodically refreshes
cached addresses
and re-resolves after camera status becomes stale, offline, or error. A failed
lookup retains the last address, marks readiness false, and retries with
backoff. go2rtc restarts only when the rendered config bytes change.

Each lookup uses one absolute deadline and a staged target order: cached IP,
global and directed broadcasts, other known registry addresses, then one
rate-limited subnet sweep. Each target gets both LAN_SEARCH3 legs followed by
KNOCK2; KNOCK_RR2 must echo the expected UID and nonce. The receiver runs
throughout the send stages. The resolver subprocess runs in AppDaemon's
executor, and only its short completion callback mutates the registry and
generated configuration.

For Docker, `DEVICES_JSON` is a JSON array. For Home Assistant, use the
structured `devices` list. Example advanced override:

```yaml
devices:
  - name: kitchen_feeder
    product: PLAF203
    serial: YOUR_DEVICE_SERIAL
    uid: YOUR_DEVICE_UID
    ip_address: 192.168.1.100
```

Omit the list for normal automatic setup.

The image includes the same resolver used by the coordinator:

```bash
petlibro-resolve \
  --uid YOUR_DEVICE_UID \
  --subnet 192.168.1.0/24 \
  --timeout 15s \
  --broadcast-duration 2s \
  --max-unicast-per-second 32 \
  --json
```

It always emits one JSON result for a valid invocation. The result includes
`resolved`, nullable `ip_address`, `method`, `elapsed_ms`, `error_code`, and
`stats`. Per-leg fields are `lan_search_w3_1_sent`,
`lan_search_w3_2_sent`, `knock2_sent`, `lan_search_r_received`, and
`knock_rr2_received`. Rejection fields are `wrong_uid_rejected`,
`nonce_mismatch_rejected`, and aggregate `responses_rejected`. The remaining
aggregate fields are `broadcasts_sent`, `unicasts_sent`, `packets_received`,
`send_errors`, and `deadline_exceeded`. The send-leg fields count successful
UDP writes; broadcast/unicast fields count logical target exchanges. It exits
nonzero when resolution fails. The coordinator invokes it without a shell and
does not log the UID or raw result.

## Logging

`log_level` accepts `critical`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`, and
`trace`; the default is `info`. `debug` is intended for ongoing troubleshooting
and excludes raw MQTT payloads and per-packet camera traces. `trace` enables
those high-volume diagnostics and should normally be used only for a short
reproduction. The legacy `verbose_logs=true` setting migrates the normal
`info` setting to `debug`; set it to `false` after choosing `log_level`.

`enable_debug_dumps` does not follow `log_level`. It separately records
decrypted C2D and D2C protocol data under `/data`; treat those files as
sensitive.

## Camera metadata topics

Metadata publishing is enabled by default. When
`camera_metadata_topic_prefix` is empty, the renderer derives:

```text
petlibro_local/<product>/<serial>/camera
```

The default 30-second heartbeat refreshes retained state and availability.
AppDaemon considers the go2rtc status stale after three heartbeat intervals.
The supported interval range is 5–300 seconds. A custom prefix may contain only
letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and slash-separated path segments; MQTT
wildcards are rejected.

See the [MQTT camera contract](mqtt-camera-contract.md) before implementing a
consumer. The generated status file is internal and should not be parsed by a
frontend integration.

## Feeder connectivity

This backend does not onboard the feeder, rewrite DNS, or configure the feeder's
factory MQTT account. The feeder must already be connected to Wi-Fi, its MQTT
hostname must resolve or route to the local broker, and its own username and
product-secret-based password must be provisioned in that broker. Do not enter
the feeder credential as the backend's MQTT password.

The configured `mqtt_username` and `mqtt_password` authenticate AppDaemon. That
account must be authorized to subscribe and publish on both the feeder's
`dl/PLAF203/...` topics and the controller's Home Assistant discovery/command
topics.

### Feeder MQTT endpoint persistence

`mqtt_host` and `mqtt_port` only tell AppDaemon how to reach the broker. They
are never copied into the physical feeder's configuration. By default,
`persist_feeder_mqtt` is false and the controller acknowledges
`DEVICE_START_EVENT` without sending `DEVICE_CONFIG_SYNC`, preserving the
feeder's existing MQTT and HTTPS endpoints.

Endpoint persistence is an advanced recovery/migration operation. To use it,
set `persist_feeder_mqtt: true`, provide a feeder-routable
`feeder_mqtt_host` and `feeder_mqtt_port`, restart the add-on, then reboot the
feeder so it emits a new startup event. The host must be an IP address or
multi-label DNS name. Before enabling the update, the
controller resolves it from the add-on, rejects loopback, link-local,
multicast, unspecified, and known Home Assistant internal addresses, then
opens a bounded TCP connection to the configured port. A validation failure is
logged and blocks the update without stopping the other backend services.

Do not use `core-mosquitto`: it is resolvable inside Home Assistant but not by
the physical feeder. Prefer a stable LAN IP or LAN DNS name whose record will
survive add-on, broker, and router changes. `feeder_https_addr` is optional; an
empty value is omitted from the update rather than being copied from another
setting. Current observed startup messages do not report the feeder's existing
endpoint values, so preservation means not sending an endpoint update when
those values cannot be read.
