# Petlibro module

The Petlibro module registers the `petlibro://` input with go2rtc. The transport
implementation is a clean-room LAN client for the Kalay/TUTK-family UDP protocol
used by Petlibro camera feeders on port `32761`.

Runtime streaming does not require a Petlibro account, vendor SDK, or CGO. The
camera must first be provisioned with the Petlibro app, and its firmware may
still depend on the vendor cloud connection to authorize LAN sessions.

## Support status

| Model | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PLAF203 | Verified | H.264 HD/SD and optional AAC audio |
| PLAF103 | Protocol evidence only | Login and bootstrap captures informed the implementation; live playback is not yet verified |
| Other Petlibro cameras | Unknown | May work when they share the same firmware protocol, but should be treated as untested |

Two-way audio is not implemented.

## URL format

```text
petlibro://CAMERA_IP?uid=20_CHARACTER_UID&quality=hd
petlibro://?uid=20_CHARACTER_UID&subnet=192.168.1.0/24&quality=hd
```

Core options:

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| URL host | no | discovery | Fixed camera address; UDP port defaults to `32761` |
| `uid` | yes | — | Exact 20-character camera UID |
| `subnet` | no | local broadcast | Additional IPv4 CIDR used for discovery; may be repeated |
| `quality` | no | `hd` | Requests and selects `hd` or `sd` video |
| `audio` | no | `false` | Requests AAC audio when `true` or `1` |
| `strict` | no | `false` | Drops damaged IDRs and dependent GOP frames instead of emitting a gapped IDR |
| `hd_probe_wait_ms` | no | `0` | Waits up to 60000 ms for a higher-resolution SPS before publishing an HD track |
| `verbose` | no | `false` | Enables compact bootstrap, probe, health, and ACK diagnostics |

The tracked [`go2rtc.example.yaml`](../../go2rtc.example.yaml) contains a
recommended PLAF203 configuration. Experimental ACK, stream-control, trace, and
capture options are documented in the
[Petlibro debugging guide](../../docs/PETLIBRO_DEBUGGING.md).

## Discovery

When the URL omits its host, go2rtc sends a UID-specific LAN search and accepts
the matching camera's response address. Local broadcast discovery requires the
camera and go2rtc process to share a broadcast domain. Add `subnet=` for routed
IPv4 networks or use a fixed address. Container discovery normally requires
host networking.

## Quality and codec probe

The default `legacy` stream-control path sends the captured Petlibro control
body for the requested quality before `IPCAM_START`. Stream selection is then
enforced from each frame's metadata byte.

On the tested PLAF203, an HD session can start with a 640x360 SPS and switch to
1920x1080 after several seconds. By default, go2rtc publishes the first usable
SPS. Set `hd_probe_wait_ms` when the first advertised RTSP description must wait
for a higher resolution. The bounded wait ends when a higher resolution appears
or the timeout expires.

Strict mode affects damaged-frame output only. It does not change stream
selection, packet parsing, ACK tracking, or recovery.

## Implementation notes

The post-login flow is:

```text
LAN_SEARCH3 -> KNOCK2 -> LOGIN A/B -> stream/bootstrap IOCtrls
  -> AV-ready ACK -> receive/maintenance loops -> H.264/AAC producer
```

The parser supports both the normal 36-byte media header and the alternate
44-byte media layout used by packet families `0c08`, `0c09`, `0c0c`, and
`0c0d`. Both layouts enter one assembler after structural validation. Main,
sub, and audio channels retain independent frame state.

Receive ACK state is independent from the assembler output cursor. The
contiguous ACK watermark advances only for wire sequences actually received;
force-draining an assembler hole does not acknowledge that missing packet.
Positions above a hole are compressed into a capped set of consecutive ranges,
preventing a single permanent gap from growing memory once per received packet.

Wire constants and captured templates live in
[`pkg/petlibro/templates.go`](../../pkg/petlibro/templates.go). Parser,
assembler, ACK, and bootstrap tests live beside the implementation in
[`pkg/petlibro`](../../pkg/petlibro/).

[debugging guide](../../docs/PETLIBRO_DEBUGGING.md). For code structure and
validation, see the [development guide](../../docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
